# Gravity Jumper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RMHSProgrammingClub/Gravity-Jumper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RMHSProgrammingClub/Gravity-Jumper)

## About ##
A game about jumping from planet to planet.

## Commit Process ##
There are different branches for different teams. The members of each team will
commit only to their respective branches. Team leads are encouraged to have
a more structured system for each person / feature, that will get merged into
the team branch at some point. When the team branches have a feature to merge
into the master branch, create a pull request that will be reviewed by Will
and Jake. Only they can accept or deny the branch merge into the master branch.

## Code Style ##
 - Java only.
 - Tabs only.
 - Curly brackets on the same line.
 - If (boolean) only. No if (boolean == true).
 - Must contain javadocs and comments.
 - Clean math with spaces between operations and parenthesis to avoid confusion.
